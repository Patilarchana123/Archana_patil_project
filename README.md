# 📦 Inventory Demand Forecasting Project 📈

An end-to-end machine learning pipeline that predicts future inventory needs and helps businesses optimize stock, reduce shortages, and avoid overstocking.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **data preprocessing**, **statistical analysis**, and **machine learning modeling** to build a **demand forecast** for inventory management.  
The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve procurement planning and streamline supply chain operations.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis** — Handle missing values, detect outliers, and uncover demand patterns.  
- ⚙️ **Feature Engineering** — Incorporate time-related features (e.g., day, month, season) to enrich predictive modeling.  
- 🤖 **Model Building & Comparison** — Train models like **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.  
- 📊 **Performance Evaluation** — Use metrics such as **MAE**, **RMSE**, and **MAPE** to assess model accuracy.  
- 📈 **Forecast Visualization** — Plot historical vs. predicted demand trends for clear insights.
